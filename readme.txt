So far none, because there is nothing coded yet. Will be provided in future. But remember, you can always drink something tasty like milkshakes or coffe, it is up to you. But know, that the more coffe you drink the more water is drained, so when drinking coffe also drink water. Usually, it is 1 cup coffe/2 cups black tea = 1 cup water. Stay hydrated.
